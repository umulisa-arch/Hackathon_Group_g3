                        <p>Societies are student groups who meet to take part in an activity or shared interest. 
                            From Media to Business, and politics to poetry – we have over 20+ student-run societies and clubs to get involved in. 
                            If you can’t find what you’re looking for, you can even start your own! As well as having fun, 
                            you can develop skills highly valued by employers. For example, 
                            joining a society committee is a great way to develop your leadership or teamwork.</p>
                        <p>The Clubs are a thriving field and every student is creative in their own, individual way. 
                            Our tutors uncover each student’s innate talents and help them to flourish in whatever discipline they are best suited to. 
                            With excellent facilities for music and visual arts, students are given the guidance, structure and means to get 
                            the best out of their creativity and skyrocket their confidence</p>
