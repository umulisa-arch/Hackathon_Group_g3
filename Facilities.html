     In case of special cases the students are immediately <br>referred to a leading hospital nearest Hospital.
      The school also has an ambulance available 24 x 7.
      Adequate access to certain health benefits may pose  <br>
      a problem for disadvantaged families seeking help, but
      having services readily accessible via a school-based health <br>
       center could change that. These types of centers are positioned in or
        adjacent to a school and offer integrated medical, behavioral health,  <br>
